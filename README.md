# Predicting-Diabetes-with-Multilayer-Perceptrons-Project


So in this project, we have designed and implemented an AI model that is capable of predicting the

onset of diabetes with around 77 percent accuracy.

We first perform exploratory data analysis where we look at the distribution of each variable as well

as the relationship between each variable and the target variable.

We then perform data processing to remove missing data and we also standardize our data that each variable

has a zero doing a standard deviation.

Finally, we split our original data randomly into a training set of data set and testing said.

We then implemented this Emoto in using the sequential model, would allow us to stack radars on one another.

We then train our machine learning model using the training set where cameras use the optimizer hour

to modify the whys and biases in the neural network, with over 200 iterations gradually improving the mode of accuracy.

Finally, we evaluated our models using metrics such as the testing, accuracy, confusion, measure and lock-Up.

We saw the importance of looking at metrics for negatives and false positives when evaluating our model

and how far negative and positive are important metrics, especially for classifier that predicts the onset of diabetes and is on in this project.
